## Meeting Notes (29th June, 2021)

### Chapter 1

* The tone of the book - slightly liberally oriented, but brings important studies from across the globe and presents multiple perspectives

* Alignment of personalities with political ideology - Facebook study - Cambridge Analytica - ethics of these studies, how do you collect data, what's your sample?

* Analogy of Economists as plumbers. Plumber analogy fits more for Software Developers and Data Engineers (Building pipelines :P)

* Mistrust with academic economists could be attributed to multiple reasons:
  * Not giving clear answers, whereas so called TV economists are more bold in making statements about the future (reduces cognitive load on the listener) and due to the open ended nature of predictions, it's not easy to satisfactorily disprove the incorrect claims made
  * Leads to disengaged audience, the aspect is probably similar to nutritional science - you're more likely to believe someone who tells you they'll help you lose weight fast etc. People in general tend to expect a certain degree of handholding to help them navigate areas outside their field of expertise
  * What if the economists are themselves biased influenced by their own motives
  * What is "good" for the economy from an economists' point of view might not be beneficial to you personally.

* Chicago Booth - Economists more optimistic about globalization, paying CEOs higher etc- Which economists were these? Was the sample diverse enough? and questions framed the same way? Also, they tend to be on the boards of big companies which might be an important influence on their stance

* CEO compensations - Can't be purely analysed in terms of supply - demand. The power concentration, belief, and value perception is discussed in the book Dictator's handbook. Plus we need to understand the incentive models better - game theory. For example, if you tax them higher, they're going to find loopholes in the law to evade those. So, you can't really force people to give up their income. The incentives have to be aligned properly.

* Understanding higher order effects is non-trivial with simple economic models. The book does a good job of highlighting these important factors in the next chapter
