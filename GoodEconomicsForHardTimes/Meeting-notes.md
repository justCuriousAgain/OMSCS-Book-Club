## Meeting Notes (29th June, 2021)

### Chapter 1

* The tone of the book - slightly liberally oriented, but brings important studies from across the globe and presents multiple perspectives

* Alignment of personalities with political ideology - Facebook study - Cambridge Analytica - ethics of these studies, how do you collect data, what's your sample?

* Analogy of Economists as plumbers. Plumber analogy fits more for Software Developers and Data Engineers (Building pipelines :P)

* Mistrust with academic economists could be attributed to multiple reasons:
  * Not giving clear answers, whereas so called TV economists are more bold in making statements about the future (reduces cognitive load on the listener) and due to the open ended nature of predictions, it's not easy to satisfactorily disprove the incorrect claims made
  * Leads to disengaged audience, the aspect is probably similar to nutritional science - you're more likely to believe someone who tells you they'll help you lose weight fast etc. People in general tend to expect a certain degree of handholding to help them navigate areas outside their field of expertise
  * What if the economists are themselves biased influenced by their own motives
  * What is "good" for the economy from an economists' point of view might not be beneficial to you personally.

* Chicago Booth - Economists more optimistic about globalization, paying CEOs higher etc- Which economists were these? Was the sample diverse enough? and questions framed the same way? Also, they tend to be on the boards of big companies which might be an important influence on their stance

* CEO compensations - Can't be purely analysed in terms of supply - demand. The power concentration, belief, and value perception is discussed in the book Dictator's handbook. Plus we need to understand the incentive models better - game theory. For example, if you tax them higher, they're going to find loopholes in the law to evade those. So, you can't really force people to give up their income. The incentives have to be aligned properly.

* Understanding higher order effects is non-trivial with simple economic models. The book does a good job of highlighting these important factors in the next chapter

### Chapter 2

* Mainly talks about how migration is not necessarily a bad thing, but doesn't delve deeper into what's the benefit to the host country. Also, doesn't discuss much on the brain drain, and its economic impacts.
  
* It seems a bit evident that they're leaning more towards the liberal side and giving a lot of examples to support their hypothesis
  
  > By liberal we mean philosophical liberalism (John Lockes philosophy of liberalism, core tenants of private property, freedom of speech, democracy, etc.). Unfortunately this term is appropriated in modern American politics to mean the "left side of the isle". In this case we don't mean the common usage (theoretically both Democrats/Republicans are philosophically liberal). Defining this because "liberal" can be a heated term whereas liberal in this sense is the dry/boring/philosophical form.

* Case for inmigration (migration within a country) is particularly interesting, and the cycle of development it creates

* Comparison between people of same skill level is not defended in the book. Also, the cost of acquiring new skills is not taken into account which can have adverse effects on the local population and create large wage gaps

* Case of automation - highlights that rich and influential people are going to keep screwing you, no matter who you are

* A new way of promoting developmental activities has been surfacing with the introduction of remote work visas provided by countries post pandemic, which is to promote tourism and consumption in their Economies

* Another way is to open institutes of higher learning in places where you intend to promote development. Since where there are students, restaurants, malls etc are going to have business, and these luxuries and amenities in turn promote industries to come and setup their units here. Examples from India, and US

* Escalating real estate costs are a by-product of high skill labor influx, which creates problems for the existing inhabitants of that place whose incomes are not as high. Also, the restrictions on height (maybe environmental issues, maybe scenic issues, not really sure) both in 3rd world countries as well as a lot of places in the developed world restrict the supply of housing

* Percolation and standing ovation effect (Model Thinking course by Scott Page on Coursera) aims to understand this phenomena with Cellular Automata model where people with similar ideologies tend to cluster together in creating very distinct bands of neighborhoods - Democrats state vs Republican States/ counties etc. And the interesting thing is this tends to happen even if the tolerance level of individuals is high (A democrat being okay to live in a neighborhood where 5/8 neighbors are Republicans and vice versa)

### Chapter 3

* This chapter effectively highlights the tradeoffs of free trade and how it's not all that simple as free trade good, tariffs bad or vice versa, and also gives recommendations for policy which is great

* Again, waterboarding of examples which tends to create the feeling that they're wresting with the issue and how there are no clear answers. Economics is particularly hard because people are involved. You do the exact same experiments, you get different results which is what makes it particularly hard

* GDP, GNP etc don't necessarily show the country's true state. It doesn't talk about the distribution of production or the wealth.

* Harder to build trust, case of Egypt etc. Local artisans lives disrupted by industries because they have the money and resources to absorb a few losses for the greater brand value. Higher consistency and dependability of products and better service. One way local enterprises can survive is if they're taken over by larger companies or their products are sold in the name of a larger brand (rebranding by Costco for instance) which can help get these people market

* Resource rich regions tend to be less democratic to start with mainly because it offers great incentives for some people to have it all for themselves which tends to create high level of power concentration

* Harder to set foot and have a say in the global work when you've just come out of a political turmoil. In this scenario if you open up your economy, you might be not in a position to negotiate in the global market, but if you strengthen your foundations first within the country it'll help set foot later on.

* Difficult for the older population to relocate and upskill. The benefits they might get from migrating/relocating do not outweigh the high costs. Also, it becomes very hard to adjust in a new community, especially at that age.

* Creation of clusters and negative impacts on livelihoods of people when these shut down (creation of ghost towns)

* Stickyness factor, and comparative advantage factor. If you just do what you're best at and the other does what they're best, this restricts scope for innovation, and building resilience to failures

* The overall benefits from free trade in one industry/region come at the cost of livelihoods of other sector/region. It's important to ensure we create a social safety net for the people who are impacted when we take such a call

* Another point to keep in mind is whether we're even asking the right questions. What are the other ways these problems can be framed?
