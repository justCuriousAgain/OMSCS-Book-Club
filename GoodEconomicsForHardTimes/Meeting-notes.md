## Meeting Notes (29th June, 2021)

### Chapter 1

* The tone of the book - slightly liberally oriented, but brings important studies from across the globe and presents multiple perspectives

* Alignment of personalities with political ideology - Facebook study - Cambridge Analytica - ethics of these studies, how do you collect data, what's your sample?

* Analogy of Economists as plumbers. Plumber analogy fits more for Software Developers and Data Engineers (Building pipelines :P)

* Mistrust with academic economists could be attributed to multiple reasons:
  * Not giving clear answers, whereas so called TV economists are more bold in making statements about the future (reduces cognitive load on the listener) and due to the open ended nature of predictions, it's not easy to satisfactorily disprove the incorrect claims made
  * Leads to disengaged audience, the aspect is probably similar to nutritional science - you're more likely to believe someone who tells you they'll help you lose weight fast etc. People in general tend to expect a certain degree of handholding to help them navigate areas outside their field of expertise
  * What if the economists are themselves biased influenced by their own motives
  * What is "good" for the economy from an economists' point of view might not be beneficial to you personally.

* Chicago Booth - Economists more optimistic about globalization, paying CEOs higher etc- Which economists were these? Was the sample diverse enough? and questions framed the same way? Also, they tend to be on the boards of big companies which might be an important influence on their stance

* CEO compensations - Can't be purely analysed in terms of supply - demand. The power concentration, belief, and value perception is discussed in the book Dictator's handbook. Plus we need to understand the incentive models better - game theory. For example, if you tax them higher, they're going to find loopholes in the law to evade those. So, you can't really force people to give up their income. The incentives have to be aligned properly.

* Understanding higher order effects is non-trivial with simple economic models. The book does a good job of highlighting these important factors in the next chapter

## Meeting Notes (6th July, 2021)

### Chapter 2

* Mainly talks about how migration is not necessarily a bad thing, but doesn't delve deeper into what's the benefit to the host country. Also, doesn't discuss much on the brain drain, and its economic impacts.
  
* It seems a bit evident that they're leaning more towards the liberal side and giving a lot of examples to support their hypothesis
  ```
  By liberal we mean philosophical liberalism (John Lockes philosophy of liberalism, core tenants of private property, freedom of speech, democracy, etc.). Unfortunately this term is appropriated in modern American politics to mean the "left side of the isle". In this case we don't mean the common usage (theoretically both Democrats/Republicans are philosophically liberal). Defining this because "liberal" can be a heated term whereas liberal in this sense is the dry/boring/philosophical form.

* Case for inmigration (migration within a country) is particularly interesting, and the cycle of development it creates

* Comparison between people of same skill level is not defended in the book. Also, the cost of acquiring new skills is not taken into account which can have adverse effects on the local population and create large wage gaps

* Case of automation - highlights that rich and influential people are going to keep screwing you, no matter who you are

* A new way of promoting developmental activities has been surfacing with the introduction of remote work visas provided by countries post pandemic, which is to promote tourism and consumption in their Economies

* Another way is to open institutes of higher learning in places where you intend to promote development. Since where there are students, restaurants, malls etc are going to have business, and these luxuries and amenities in turn promote industries to come and setup their units here. Examples from India, and US

* Escalating real estate costs are a by-product of high skill labor influx, which creates problems for the existing inhabitants of that place whose incomes are not as high. Also, the restrictions on height (maybe environmental issues, maybe scenic issues, not really sure) both in 3rd world countries as well as a lot of places in the developed world restrict the supply of housing

* Percolation and standing ovation effect (Model Thinking course by Scott Page on Coursera) aims to understand this phenomena with Cellular Automata model where people with similar ideologies tend to cluster together in creating very distinct bands of neighborhoods - Democrats state vs Republican States/ counties etc. And the interesting thing is this tends to happen even if the tolerance level of individuals is high (A democrat being okay to live in a neighborhood where 5/8 neighbors are Republicans and vice versa)
