## Meeting Notes (29th June, 2021)

### Chapter 1

* The tone of the book - slightly liberally oriented, but brings important studies from across the globe and presents multiple perspectives

* Alignment of personalities with political ideology - Facebook study - Cambridge Analytica - ethics of these studies, how do you collect data, what's your sample?

* Analogy of Economists as plumbers. Plumber analogy fits more for Software Developers and Data Engineers (Building pipelines :P)

* Mistrust with academic economists could be attributed to multiple reasons:
  * Not giving clear answers, whereas so called TV economists are more bold in making statements about the future (reduces cognitive load on the listener) and due to the open ended nature of predictions, it's not easy to satisfactorily disprove the incorrect claims made
  * Leads to disengaged audience, the aspect is probably similar to nutritional science - you're more likely to believe someone who tells you they'll help you lose weight fast etc. People in general tend to expect a certain degree of handholding to help them navigate areas outside their field of expertise
  * What if the economists are themselves biased influenced by their own motives
  * What is "good" for the economy from an economists' point of view might not be beneficial to you personally.

* Chicago Booth - Economists more optimistic about globalization, paying CEOs higher etc- Which economists were these? Was the sample diverse enough? and questions framed the same way? Also, they tend to be on the boards of big companies which might be an important influence on their stance

* CEO compensations - Can't be purely analysed in terms of supply - demand. The power concentration, belief, and value perception is discussed in the book Dictator's handbook. Plus we need to understand the incentive models better - game theory. For example, if you tax them higher, they're going to find loopholes in the law to evade those. So, you can't really force people to give up their income. The incentives have to be aligned properly.

* Understanding higher order effects is non-trivial with simple economic models. The book does a good job of highlighting these important factors in the next chapter

### Chapter 2

* Mainly talks about how migration is not necessarily a bad thing, but doesn't delve deeper into what's the benefit to the host country. Also, doesn't discuss much on the brain drain, and its economic impacts.
  
* It seems a bit evident that they're leaning more towards the liberal side and giving a lot of examples to support their hypothesis
  
  > By liberal we mean philosophical liberalism (John Lockes philosophy of liberalism, core tenants of private property, freedom of speech, democracy, etc.). Unfortunately this term is appropriated in modern American politics to mean the "left side of the isle". In this case we don't mean the common usage (theoretically both Democrats/Republicans are philosophically liberal). Defining this because "liberal" can be a heated term whereas liberal in this sense is the dry/boring/philosophical form.

* Case for inmigration (migration within a country) is particularly interesting, and the cycle of development it creates

* Comparison between people of same skill level is not defended in the book. Also, the cost of acquiring new skills is not taken into account which can have adverse effects on the local population and create large wage gaps

* Case of automation - highlights that rich and influential people are going to keep screwing you, no matter who you are

* A new way of promoting developmental activities has been surfacing with the introduction of remote work visas provided by countries post pandemic, which is to promote tourism and consumption in their Economies

* Another way is to open institutes of higher learning in places where you intend to promote development. Since where there are students, restaurants, malls etc are going to have business, and these luxuries and amenities in turn promote industries to come and setup their units here. Examples from India, and US

* Escalating real estate costs are a by-product of high skill labor influx, which creates problems for the existing inhabitants of that place whose incomes are not as high. Also, the restrictions on height (maybe environmental issues, maybe scenic issues, not really sure) both in 3rd world countries as well as a lot of places in the developed world restrict the supply of housing

* Percolation and standing ovation effect (Model Thinking course by Scott Page on Coursera) aims to understand this phenomena with Cellular Automata model where people with similar ideologies tend to cluster together in creating very distinct bands of neighborhoods - Democrats state vs Republican States/ counties etc. And the interesting thing is this tends to happen even if the tolerance level of individuals is high (A democrat being okay to live in a neighborhood where 5/8 neighbors are Republicans and vice versa)

### Chapter 3

* This chapter effectively highlights the tradeoffs of free trade and how it's not all that simple as free trade good, tariffs bad or vice versa, and also gives recommendations for policy which is great

* Again, waterboarding of examples which tends to create the feeling that they're wresting with the issue and how there are no clear answers. Economics is particularly hard because people are involved. You do the exact same experiments, you get different results which is what makes it particularly hard

* GDP, GNP etc don't necessarily show the country's true state. It doesn't talk about the distribution of production or the wealth.

* Harder to build trust, case of Egypt etc. Local artisans lives disrupted by industries because they have the money and resources to absorb a few losses for the greater brand value. Higher consistency and dependability of products and better service. One way local enterprises can survive is if they're taken over by larger companies or their products are sold in the name of a larger brand (rebranding by Costco for instance) which can help get these people market

* Resource rich regions tend to be less democratic to start with mainly because it offers great incentives for some people to have it all for themselves which tends to create high level of power concentration

* Harder to set foot and have a say in the global work when you've just come out of a political turmoil. In this scenario if you open up your economy, you might be not in a position to negotiate in the global market, but if you strengthen your foundations first within the country it'll help set foot later on.

* Difficult for the older population to relocate and upskill. The benefits they might get from migrating/relocating do not outweigh the high costs. Also, it becomes very hard to adjust in a new community, especially at that age.

* Creation of clusters and negative impacts on livelihoods of people when these shut down (creation of ghost towns)

* Stickyness factor, and comparative advantage factor. If you just do what you're best at and the other does what they're best, this restricts scope for innovation, and building resilience to failures

* The overall benefits from free trade in one industry/region come at the cost of livelihoods of other sector/region. It's important to ensure we create a social safety net for the people who are impacted when we take such a call

* Another point to keep in mind is whether we're even asking the right questions. What are the other ways these problems can be framed?

## Meeting Notes (28th July, 2021)

### Chapter 4

* Here they mainly touch on discrimination, not so much directly on wants and needs, however they do highlight how a lot of this can be influenced by social conformity, and try to make a case for how inclusivity can help overcome discrimination and growing polarization.

* Hearing out the other side, just allowing yourself to hear out the arguments, may not always directly make sense to you - as in the case of buying a TV example when the person doesn't have food to eat
  * Quote by Voltaire - "I may not agree with you, but I'll protect to my death your right to say it"

* Is better connectedness the reason for growing polarization?
  * Earlier, only the media or the people in power had the say (Winner gets to write the story), now everyone can share their story
  * The problem is with echo chambers and filter bubbles, which puts you in circle with people having similar beliefs as you, and the same thoughts or ideology fed back in a loop reinforces those beliefs and make it harder to unlearn.
  * Reference to Newt Gingrich (Republican elected in 1994): [The Man who broke politics - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/)

* Allowing people to choose automatically has the impact of bringing people to the centre or making them more neutral - depends on their goals, and whether the topic has any political angle to it or not

* Voters voting for a person from their caste - more of apathy and familiarity than any particular affection for their caste

* "Personality predates ideology" - relation to how you allow yourself be swayed by these echo chambers or certain ideologies

* Affordable care Act vs Obamacare (catch: they're the same, and the name was put by Republicans, not Democrats)

* Self-discrimination - How being reminded of your stereotypes can impact performance on certain parameters
  * Just to overcome those stereotypes, some people have had to put in double the effort to stand out and being accepted

* Impact on policy - making schools more inclusive? Creating government housing in neighborhoods to allow mixing.
  * Impact of dorm allocations based on regions, or ranks in the entrance exam and the impact on the personality, ideology and beliefs of the individuals

* How does this all relate to economics? - Well, economics is really about people and the dynamics of value in a society, more than anything else

## Meeting Notes (11th August, 2021)

* Green Knight Movie (Not in the environmental sense)

### Chapter 6

* Limitations of GDP based reasoning (growing the pie)

* Carbon pricing/credits Tesla - money from government grants, who pays for the environment question

* Carbon taxes and who bears the burden - French have a different level of protesting

* Air-conditioning and use of clean-tech in Indian context, productivity and Maslow's hierarchy of Needs. Simple changes like using a clean stove etc can be influenced by a lot of socio-economic and psychological factors ()

* Promoting safe and clean technologies by incentivizing distributors (they get more commission on installing environmental friendly devices etc.)

* Delhi, its polllution levels, influence of political conflicts (different governments in Delhi and neighboring states), which makes it a "your problem, not mine" kind of situation. Public transport, odd-even etc helped but not a solution, unless the crop burning stops.

* The claim is that poorer countries will be the more severely impacted by climate change, and that gives even lesser incentive to the rick countries to pay for it. But it's important to realize even if the effects might not be as direct as in countries near the equator, the indirect effects are a lot. For instance, remember the example of a nuclear test being conducted in the vicinity of a residential town led to complications in people's health, reproductive potential etc. Similarly, over the years, change in environmental levels of carbon have contributed to nutritional deficiency in the crops, which leads to higher food consumption for getting the same amount of nutrition, and in turn obesity, and higher risk of disease and death

* Bladerunner vs Star-trek analogy - Without mindset/social change, involving the younger generation in the discussion, the situation will be similar to "if your house is on fire, you say, oh, let's divert it to the bedroom or the veranda instead of putting it out". Sure that could be means to a solution, but not the end in itself

* Tethering the earth with the space station - Space capsule?

* Freakonomics episode - Prophet vs Wizard <https://freakonomics.com/podcast/save-the-planet/>

* Larger institutions contributing to majority (like Military, Bitcoin mining, AI etc.). How would individual contributions or sacrifices make a difference this way? 10% of entities responsible for more than 50% of emissions

* Will we get out of this mess, if at all, if yes, how? Will it come throught technological innovation or societal change is necessary? How do you align the actors towards a common goal?

* Solutions discussed more in the context of capitalistic or economic markets based mindset. How does the situation work for communist economies etc. Capitalism is profit driven so it's usually very flexible and adaptive as long as there's profit potential

* Instead of asking people to change their behavior, give them a system which automaticallly shifts their behavior, they usually won't go back. People have a lot of inertia. Take the example of smartphone apps. They don't always explicitly ask for every permission, instead they just provide the option for you to turn it off if you want, which people usually don't do

## Meeting Notes (18th August, 2021)

* Dall-E movie by Pixar

### Chapter 7

* The starting of this chapter relates to the points in the book "Hello World" by Hannah fry and "The War on Normal People" by Andrew Yang. Also, interestingly brings home the point that a lot of problems in the economy are not actually economic in nature (there's no economic iron law preventing you from creating a more humane world), but rather political in nature driven by people's ignorance, self-interests or resistance to change.

* Even with automation, new jobs are created, however, as mentioned the adjustment can take very long to settle. People are not so fast at adapting, especially people who are 40 and above, because of the additional constraints of family/parental responsibilities, health issues etc. The young ones might be okay though. Again that depends on the level of privilege they're coming from. However, nobody really knows how it's actually going to turn out.

* Related to the sticky economy concept brought up in the migration chapter. People won't just automatically move to places where there are more jobs.

* Interesting point on the tax bias towards labor vs machine which makes it beneficial for corporations to go with robots and automation even if they're not as efficient or are more costly than labor. Also, deprecation in machines can be used to waive off taxes, and fricton between corps and labor unions doesn't help either.

* Reagan and Thatcher's era, the policy decisions of reducing the taxes - trickle down economics - doesn't work in practice though. The inequality actually increased, the real wages in many cases at the bottom actually went down. At that time, there was no data to support that focusing on growth by reducing taxes won't help, but now it's showing. However, there's another catch. If you try to increase taxes, you might be self-sabotaging as a political party since the same people you're planning to tax more are the ones who finance your campaigns, and with the cap on campaign financing removed, this makes the transition even harder. Also, more taxes just incentivise people to find new ways of evading those. It can't work very well unless everyone comes on the same page which is highly unlikely to happen in the near future. (Example - recent talks on the tax rates were shut down by Ireland)

* Less taxation on money made through stocks etc. Capital gains tax.

* CEO pay - relation to sports - winning matters - The people at the top don't really care too much about the exact figures they make as long as they maintain the title of being at the top or the best. This is actually a reasonable way to help the money trickle down and allow more opportunities to tackle inequality.

* Finance and brain drain - Because of extremely high incomes in the finance industry, a lot of great talent is lost to it (Trend common in India too: Graduates from top colleges leaving their core fields/majors and drifting to finance and software jobs, not just in the western world), which has 3 problems at least:
  * A lot of smart people tend to work on the same problems, so the marginal value they're adding becomes insignificant.
  * A large number of potential opportunities and innovations in other domains are lost, or never get to fruition.
  * Due to the concentration being in certain fields, it restricts other fields from even growing, since the social circle matters and you're more likely to be working with smarter people if you're in the fields they're concentrated in and that creates a vicious loop.

* The issue with american dream - numerous factors may be stacked against you which prevent you from rising, but the perception is that you're not able to grow so you're the one who's lazy, you're not working hard enough etc.
  
* Higher mortality among the less than college educated white people - depression - mental health - outlet in the form of despair, anger and desperation - political extremism - self help industry boost - more vulnerable people to exploit - affiliate marketing - babas in India, etc.
  
* 9% making it to the top is not bad at all. Not everyone's going to ride a Ferrari or a Mazerati, nor they care. But they should atleast be able to live a comfortable life with dignity - China's making attempts for that, to bring people up from destitute poverty, which helps garner more support for the government too. The tradeoffs are different there.

  * China's rising middle class. Govt attempts against ultra rich, sesame credit etc.

  * The rise of blockchain and the recent interventions by the government to ban some large private enterprises
