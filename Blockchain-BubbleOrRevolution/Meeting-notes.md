# Meeting notes

## Meeting Notes (25th May, 2021)

### Introduction

Jordan refugee camp:

* Who's mining refugee dollars? (Probably matters more in crypto)
* Mining - Part of defence mechanism to make it harder to get more currency as we move forward
* How are the privacy concerns dealt with? What if someone's record gets tampered with?
* Do we need Blockchain for this?
* Orphaned branches?

### Chapter 1

* Block-reward. When Bitcoin reaches its max limit, is there any incentive? -- The mining fee of a given transaction (variable based on currency)
* Simplification using metaphors is good, but the problem is knowing when the metaphor ends (Context: Excel spreadsheet analogy for Blockchain)
* Who is crypto serving? Is it solution in search of a problem? - Tip someone/NGOs? Wire Transfer? Use as Digital Cash
* How do you read the ledger? What does it really contain?
Ethereum's hack, and the fork

### Chapter 2

* Reference to Yuval Noah Harari - Collectively tell stories, we all assign value collectively. It's not always scarcity.
* The greater fool theory
* What even is currency? Expectation that someone else will take it too. But then what is investment? and how is that different?
* How can we avoid rapid fluctuations caused by high profile people like Elon Musk. How does regulation even work here?

## Meeting Notes (1st June, 2021):

### Chapter 3

* Prompt: Satoshi's vision in small transactions. How do you define success in Bitcoin? Is the price going up to be considered as success?
* Other tech getting in that realm - Nano - you mine for your own transaction?
* Example stated for use different that original intended purpose: Listerine - bathroom cleaner - repurposed to mouthwash
* Gives people the optionality to send money through a different mechanism - leads to innovation
* Bitcoin - Nerds of a cash - Pic of few men in a conference controlling 90% of bitcoin - exact opposite of what Satoshi envisioned. Also, NO WOMEN.
* Satoshi thought of a gentleman's agreement - put a level of faith in how people would use it - people didn't really care - Mining Rigs
Podcast with Brendon (Brave browser) - release something new quick - has a time to adapt and iterate
* Trading volume at its peak - 2000 trades per second - but obviously can't be done so .....Computers can way better than this - example - the book Flashboys - 2008 financial crisis
* How to help guide the future of crypto? How to guide regulations
* IRS - Disclose amount any income over 10000 USD - California - doubling the workforce just to handle this
* With regards to the power consumption on mining rigs - Slippery slope - What counts as useful/relevant? Ethical framework - Utilitarianism - How do you quantify?
..

### Chapter 4

* Ethereum smart-contracts vs microservices? How does it make any difference? A democratic alternative?
* Naturally limit the number of people who can provide feedback - Proof of stake system
* Fundamentally opens up the world of possibilities with things like forking. Getting adoption rates is actually hard though.
* Concept of stable-coins as alternate coins
* Crypto touches on points that are deeply flawed in our existing systems, sometimes highlighting them, sometimes reinforcing, and occasionally fixing them
* Would like to see how political systems adapt to this and how the power dynamics in the world change as a result
* Regulation is still an open question.

## Meeting Notes (8th June, 2021)

### Chapter 5

* The voting example seems to ignore bigger issue of voter suppression. Need to consider the accessibility issue.
* The IPFS example was interesting reminds of inter-library system.
* The trademark example: Need confirmation with the government office first. Admissibility in court? Could act as part of system but not the system itself.
* Appeal in public blockchain vs private blockchain. Adoption is easier in private ones, in the other case, you need enough people to even get it running.

### Chapter 6

* Walmart example. People hopped on with the blockchain coz they wanted to work with Walmart and not directly coz of the appeal of blockchain.
* Economies of scale likely helped with the adoption. But do we really need the blockchain? Trustlessness, decentralization, protection against ransomware.
* Setting up audit trails, and tamper-resistant nature, along with offering transparency.
* Merging AI can be helpful, and notifications could be sent.
* Blockchain's use for contact tracing in COVID. Need to see how that works, and the 2nd order consequences.
* Bloomberg - API hookups, real-time data etc. How do you handle such a huge volume of transactions with Blockchain. Australian stock exchange.
* X-Box example. Royalty resolution issue. Math encoded into the contract makes it less likely to be subject to misinterpretation. Gets rid of ambiguity.
* Fighting tech debt takes a political turn in large companies.
