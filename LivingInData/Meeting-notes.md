## Meeting Notes (22nd December, 2021)

### Preface

* Examples quite up to date as opposed to the old timey examples in "How to lie with statistics"
* Use of data as a creative pursuit, lack of application driven approach - had to close down studio due to lack of funding
* Artistic pursuits are cool, but need to be mindful of it's use.
* Data is not just data, it's impacting someone's life

### Chapter 1

* School example - Fallacy of confusing a satisfactory story with a meaningful one
* What was even the point of the study mentioned?
* Concerns around what data can be used for, and its interpretations
* Forgetting curve is an example - Sample size was 1, but it's been used as a basis for a lot of products and even studies
* Sociograms - Finding groups of people with aligned interests and finding arrangements
* Tiktok's algorithm study - depressed person likely to be shown depressive content
* Web3.0 - incentive alignments as compared to the advertising incentives that places activity on platform at the forefront than user's well being
* Federated service
* Trimming the suit vs trimming the person to fit in the suit. Life experience shaped as a result of algorithms
* Curious to see how to build the two-way street that the author talks about

## Meeting Notes (12th January, 2022)

### Chapter 4

* Expedition: Got funded because of mines and that a war had recently broke out. Data Black hole - so much of history was never recorded.
* Important to have understanding of population you're collecting data from
* Access to technology tied to the needs, and different technology automatically biases the kind of data that can be collected
* Development of satellite system to live blog their discoveries.
* Parallels between Ebola and "the cool new thing called contact tracing"
* In CS, things might not directy map to real physical things. Cloud is not some ethereal thing, it's ultimately tied back to real labor and resources - Server farms
* Do no harm. But there's always a tradeoff between Discovery and Ethics. Alan Turing keeping data to himself to avoid misuse by authorities. Institutional control on data vs open sourcing data.
* Theranos founder first CEO to actually be charged for its ethics in terms of misrepresentation to get funding from investors.

### Chapter 5

* Targeted advertising, does it work, does it not work?
* Browser extensions that randomly click on ads for confusing the companies about you.
* The insidious forms of advertising are more impactful than the large banner stuff.
* Recommendation systems vs chronological ordering and influence on people's thoughts.
* Webpages are taking longer to load even with faster internet speeds because there's a bidding process that goes on the backend to decide which one shows up
* Vickrey auction
* GDPR aims to make users more aware of the cookies and their use
* jsfiddle ads, tie-up between adBlockPlus and advertisers - no obnoxious ads

### Chapter 6

* Metadata determines and is biased by what we think is important. A simple example would be what are we capturing about the OMSCS students in their database.
They might be capturing our grades, courses taken, application data, but not how much time we spent on forums, etc.
* The fact that someone has to make applications interacting with this data adds another layer of bias into design of the schema, which again restricts the expression.
* Workability vs specificity tradeoff. In talking about gender/race questions, making it male/female/other puts people confirming within the spectrum feel like being excluded. On the other hand, leaving it free flowing to help people express themselves well, but that reduces the usability of the data.
* The social political context of the world at a given time decides the questions that people ask, and that automatically restricts the expression of reality.

### Chapter 7

* Neural network vs class of kids with cookies.
* Any abstraction and analogy at some level breaks down. It's important to recognize where that level is.
* Book feels a lot more like a collection of short stories vs a novel.
* Not really clear what's the new fad of digital fashion
* NFTs, FashionAR, hopping to the 'next' thing. It's not about the product. It's about the feeling of being perceived part of a certain community.
