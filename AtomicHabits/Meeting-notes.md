## Meeting Notes (8th September, 2021)

### Introduction and Chapter 1

* Important to consider the contrarian side as well if you feel you're agreeing too much with the author
* Outcome driven actions vs identity driven actions
* Intro feels almost like movie-ish; relatable through a personal story; and starts with an interesting hook
* Building an environment that allows for comfortable failing
* Letting it be vs actively fighting setbacks
* Might be difficult to figure out what's wrong during the valley of disappointment
* Make an investment when it's needed instead of upfront
* Mindfulness, living in the moment, the reward is in the now
* The effect of environment. What can you do now, that you won't be able to do later?
* Started the book club to make that feedback loop :p Take the iterative deepening approach to review habits every once in a while
* Joke about "83rd day of the Hard book on Economics :P"
