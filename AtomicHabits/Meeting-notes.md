## Meeting Notes (8th September, 2021)

### Introduction and Chapter 1

* Important to consider the contrarian side as well if you feel you're agreeing too much with the author
* Outcome driven actions vs identity driven actions
* Intro feels almost like movie-ish; relatable through a personal story; and starts with an interesting hook
* Building an environment that allows for comfortable failing
* Letting it be vs actively fighting setbacks
* Might be difficult to figure out what's wrong during the valley of disappointment
* Make an investment when it's needed instead of upfront
* Mindfulness, living in the moment, the reward is in the now
* The effect of environment. What can you do now, that you won't be able to do later?
* Started the book club to make that feedback loop :p Take the iterative deepening approach to review habits every once in a while
* Joke about "83rd day of the Hard book on Economics :P"

### Chapter 2 and Chapter 3

* *HCI is a lot of writing...* - Quin
* There is a wide range of thoughts on identity as a tool for building habits. While some in the group say this resonates strongly with them, others don't find that it necessarily fits their current model for habit-building.
* On the feedback loop between identity and habits, which comes first (the chicken or the egg)?
* The formation of certain types of habits can be heavily influenced by factors outside your control (e.g. access to resources, age, stages of life, environment and peers).
  * Discussed the example (from Gladwell's Outliers?) of kids in hockey. Kids who are slightly older than their peers tend to do better at the sport through adulthood because they were more developed than their peers at a young age.
  * Mentioned that the book doesn't appear to talk much about:
    * The role of privilege and access to resources in success/competency, and
    * Other external factors
* Latching on to certain identities can also hold one back:
  * Specific example: being terrible at directions
  * Working at the skill (being forced/encouraged to?) causes one to be better at it.
* Can working on identity-building be a tool against imposter syndrome?
  * Identity is self-determined but we need external measures as well, e.g. feedback from someone more senior.
* On the four steps (cue - craving - response - reward):
  * Missing one or two steps can affect how well one is able to build habits
    * Being thrown off of good habits by the pandemic
  * Why do rewards for many habits seem intrinsic while for good habits they often need to be manufactured?
* Some helpful applications of tips from the books:
  * Moving things (candy) out of sight
  * Putting phone on silent while working

## Meeting Notes (22nd September, 2021)

### Chapter 4 and 5

* MTA - point and calling - Checklist manifesto
* HCI - Watching a video - tap it and tap it to make it larger
* Catch phrase (takiakalam) - subconscious cues
* Reaching for phone when it hurts
* It's about identity, but a plan is important too
* Create a new habit
  * Al - Stop checking phone on waking up. Look out of the window.
  * Frank - Trying to break off some bad habits
  * Sonum - Start working early, and working out in the morning
  * Pratik - Journaling
  * Quin - Get the requisition done

## Meeting Notes (20th October, 2021)

### Chapter 12 and 13

* Agriculture example a bit cherry-picked and oversimplified; the impact of aerable land and other factors ignored: <https://www.mapsofworld.com/answers/world/percent-agricultural-land-world/>
  * The Japanese industry example from the 1970s-80s demonstrates the least effort law better
* Getting into momentum (2 minute rule) helps but there needs to be fuel to keep it going - My gym example. Even though reached the gym, didn't feel like doing the workouts
* Also, the environment organization is personal to each individual; Someone's workspace might look totally messy to another person, but that workspace organization might be efficient for the person using it
* Friction and people in your environment can help make or break the habit - Family members change their plans and you gotta comply, hard to stay consistent when the environment is so unpredictable - Made it difficult for Sonum to follow through on the morning workout ritual
* Value and impact of existing expertise, and the people around you (community, friends etc) - Quin's gym example where the new guy was struggling, but Quin's suggestion helped that person pick the right workout for the day and based on his current level
* Quin's requisition too much effort, will need to waste his lunch break, and can't eat stuff for a day with not much use, so ditched it
* Pratik started on the journalling thing, but a few events and travel broke the habit. Need to get into that again, and in a way that builds up without getting overwhelming
* Procrastination - Tim Urban's article
* Quin needs to get a new set of headphones/speakers - audio jack's broken
* Needs to spend 3 months before spending money - If he's not dropped the idea then it's probably a good idea to buy the thing
* Dishwasher hacks: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBO8neWw04>
